# 2dArray-sharedmem

```
1) One could create only so much shared memory in the linux system. 
2) Because of the limitation, it's easier to implement 2DArray hash instead of hashtable using linkedlist


Here is the  hashtable with LinkedList implementation: https://github.com/osnetsvn/hashtable-using-sharedmemory
```
```
1)Compile the code by running make
```
